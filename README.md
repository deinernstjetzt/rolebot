# rolebot: Discord bot to assign roles to users
I am writing this bot while I am learning go. The code
is probably not great, but I am trying my best.

Features:
- Give users a specific role when they add a reaction to a message.
- Quickly add and remove those roles using some build in commands.
- You can add and remove admins to give users access to the !addrole and !remrole commands

Commands:

```
!addrole @Role :emoji:
!remrole @Role
!addadmin @NewAdmin
!remadmin @RemAdmin
!addserver
```
